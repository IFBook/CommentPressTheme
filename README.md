Commentpress Theme
==================

Commentpress is an open source theme and plugin for WordPress that allows readers to comment paragraph by paragraph in the margins of a text.

Annotate, gloss, workshop, debate: with Commentpress you can do all of these things on a finer-grained level, turning a document into a conversation. It can be applied to a fixed document (paper/essay/book etc.) or to a running blog.

Please note: this theme only works with the official [Commentpress Plugin](https://github.com/IFBook/CommentPressPlugin).

For further information and instructions please see the [Commentpress site](http://www.futureofthebook.org/commentpress/)

## Installation ##

This theme only works in combination with the [Commentpress Plugin](https://github.com/IFBook/CommentPressPlugin). Please install and activate the theme by doing the following:

1. Unzip the .zip file and, if needed, rename the enclosing folder so that the theme's files are located directly inside `/wp-content/themes/commentpress`
2. Activate the theme.
3. Visit settings pages and configure theme.
4. You are done!

_Note:_ it is assumed that if you're using `git clone` to install the theme, then you probably don't need detailed instructions on how to do so!
